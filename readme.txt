# Weather Underground

This app gets the last data from you Personal Weather Station that is hosted on the Weather Underground web site.

If your weather station can be added to Weather Underground you will get a free access key once it is publishing data to their site.
You need to follow the instruction supplied with your weather station to add it to Weather Underground.

This app can use the "Location ID" and "Access Key" provided by Weather Underground to grab the last set of data from your weather station once every minute.
The Weather Underground web site limits requests to 10 per minute and 1500 per day. So I have chosen to refresh the data at 1 minutes intervals so it can run all day without being blocked.

To add your station to the app:
* Install the app.
* Add a new device,
* Choose the Weather Underground icon,
* Enter the "Station ID" and "Access Key" that is provide by Weather Underground,
