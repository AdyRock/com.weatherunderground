# Weather Underground

This app gets the last data from you Personal Weather Station that is hosted on the Weather Underground web site.

If your weather station can be added to Weather Underground you will get a free access key once it is publishing data to their site.
You need to follow the instruction supplied with your weather station to add it to Weather Underground.

This app can use the location ID and access key to grab the data from Weather Underground once every minute. The web site limits requests to 10 per minutes and 1500 per day so I have chosen 1 minutes intervals so it can run all day.

To add your station to the app:
* Install the app and then add a new device,
* Choose the Weather Station icon,
* Enter the Station ID and access key that is provide by Weather Underground,
