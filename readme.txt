This app gets the last data from you Personal Weather Station that is hosted on the Weather Underground web site.
It can also get tomorrows forecast for your stations location.

If your weather station can be added to Weather Underground you will get a free API key once it is publishing data to their site.
You need to follow the instruction supplied with your weather station to add it to Weather Underground.

This app can use the "Station ID" and "Your API key". These can be found on your Members Settings page of the Weather Underground site. "Station ID" is on the "My Devices" tab and "Your API key" is on the "API KEYS" tab. The app gathers the information for your weather station from the Weather Underground site once every minute. The web site limits requests to 10 per minutes and 1500 per day so I have chosen 1 minutes intervals so it can run all day.

To add your Weather Station to the app:
* Install the app and then add a new device,
* Choose the Weather Station icon,
* Enter your "Station ID" and "Your API key" that is provide by Weather Underground,
* Tap the Add Station button. It takes a few seconds to gather the information before the screen disappears.
