This app gets the last data from you Personal Weather Station that is hosted on the Weather Underground web site.
It can also get tomorrows forecast for your stations location.

If your weather station can be added to Weather Underground you will get a free API key once it is publishing data to their site.
You need to follow the instruction supplied with your weather station to add it to Weather Underground.

This app can use the station "ID", found on the "My Devices", and "Your API key", found on the "API KEYS" tab, of your weather station to grab the data from Weather Underground once every minute. The web site limits requests to 10 per minutes and 1500 per day so I have chosen 1 minutes intervals so it can run all day.

To add your station to the app:
* Install the app and then add a new device,
* Choose the Weather Station icon,
* Enter your station "ID" and "Your API key" that is provide by Weather Underground,

To add tomorrows forecast to the app:
* Install the app and then add a new device,
* Choose the Forecast icon,
* Enter your station "ID" and "Your API key" that is provide by Weather Underground,
